#OpenXcom Nationalities Expanded Mod v1.0
#Authors: B1ackwolf, efrenespartano & Czechball, based on the works previously made by Solarius Scorch

This mod requires OXCE to work

README for Version 1.0

The general idea of the mod is to implement the flags on name and extra nationalities namelist into a flexible and compatible format, so it can be integrated unto others mods with ease, or used in a vainilla run, yet retaining the fluff of having your soldiers showing their national colors.  
The work is based on Solarius Scorch FMP and XFILES, at first i expanded the names for personal use but i figured some others might wish to use it.

The mod consist in two main features:

°115 flags: to represent different backgrounds and nationalities
°115 NAMELIST: to accompany the flags, there are the same number of .nam files, fleshed out to have aproximately 500 male names, 500 female names and AT LEAST 1000 surnames....also taking in consideration nuances and traditions from different countries so there are special cases where male or female surnames are separated by suffixes 
(-eva, -ova ,-ska in slavic female surnames,-itė or -ienė in lithuanian female lithuanian according to their marital statuses, -tter or -son according to gender on icelandic surnames...just to name a few examples)

In order to use it all you need to do its simply drop the mod in your folder and activate it via menu, in case you wish to integrate it to your mods new types of units, just copy and paste these parameters on every unit to have the name list apply to your units:

#soldiers:
#  - type: STR_SUPER_UNIQUE_NEW_SOLDIER
#    soldierNames:
#      - delete
#      - SoldierNames/
