#TFTD More Funders Nationalities Expanded Mod v1.0
#Authors: B1ackwolf, efrenespartano & Czechball, based on the works previously made by Solarius Scorch

This mod requires OXCE to work

README for Version 1.0

The general idea of the mod is to implement the flags on name and extra nationalities namelist into a flexible and compatible format, so it can be integrated unto others mods with ease, or used in a vainilla run, yet retaining the fluff of having your soldiers showing their national colors.  

Features: 

>> 50 new flags by Czechball, a new world order demands new flags
>> 50 name lists written by B1ackwolf and Ostrich-Hungry
> Several name lists are mix of the national lists of the former territories within the conglomerates (i.e. Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian names in Scandinavia) or have additional first names from neighboring regions (i.e. People's Republic of Alaska has Russian first names but American surnames)

In order to use it all you need to do its simply drop the mod in your folder and activate it via menu, in case you wish to integrate it to your mods new types of units, just copy and paste these parameters on every unit to have the name list apply to your units:

#soldiers:
#  - type: STR_SUPER_UNIQUE_NEW_SOLDIER
#    soldierNames:
#      - delete
#      - SoldierNames/
